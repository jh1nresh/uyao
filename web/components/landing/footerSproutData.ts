 * Footer-only Sprout: the landing footer crops the mascot at its waist, and the
 * stock face cannot survive that cut because the eyes are centred on the head
 * (y 0 of a head spanning -75..75) and are 53 units tall on a 150-unit head.
 *
 * Lifting them means shrinking them too: the head narrows towards the crown, so
 * a full-height eye raised far enough to clear the crop line would spill past
 * the silhouette and get clipped by the head path.
 *
 * `positionY` is an arc-length parameter, not a pixel offset — the runtime maps
 * it through `120 * sin(positionY / 120)` onto the head sphere, so the values
 * here are pre-image coordinates for the intended on-screen centre.
